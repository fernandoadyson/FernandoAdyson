Enthusiast of the best web development technologies.

Passionate about teaching and learning. More than 15 people have passed through my team leadership.

"Nothing in this world beats good old persistence. Talent does not overcome. Nothing is more common than talented failures. Genius does not overcome. Unrecognized genius is practically a clich√©. Education does not exceed. The world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are powerful."
